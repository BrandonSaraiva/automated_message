**IN ORDER FOR THE CODE TO WORK, YOU CANNOT HAVE ANY CHROME TAB OPEN, THE CHROME MUST BE DESTINED ONLY FOR THIS BOT!!**

**IF THE MOUSE TRYS TO CLICK ON YOUR CHROME PROFILE AND MAKES A MISTAKE, CLICK ON IT MANUALLY (THIS CODE WAS SET WITH MY PC'S PIXELS, SO THIS CAN HAPPEN)**

1. Make sure you have Google Chrome installed on your machine.

2. Log in to WhatsApp Web and the Shopee platform, leave your Google account logged in to Google Chrome as well, leaving the "stay me signed in" option activated. This will allow the code to utilize your preferences and run locally correctly.

3. Download and run the executable provided in the "Dist" folder. When executed, the program will display a command screen.

4. Remember to enter the name of your contact who will receive the message correctly in the input when requested.

5. When the terminal opens, press any key to display the messages if they are not appearing. The texts displayed will be self-explanatory and will provide guidance on the necessary inputs.

Daily at 10 pm, the bot will access the Shopee platform and click on the daily check to provide the daily coin bonus.

Make sure you follow these steps and provide the necessary information for the bot to function correctly.
